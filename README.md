# Python YAML Use Case

This project demonstrates how to use YAML files in Python to store and retrieve student data. It includes a script to display all students and filter them based on their GPA.

## Installation

To use this project, ensure you have Python installed and install the required library:

```sh
pip install pyyaml
```

## YAML File Structure

Create a file named `students.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
students:
  - name: Alice
    age: 21
    major: Computer Science
    gpa: 3.8
  - name: Bob
    age: 22
    major: Mathematics
    gpa: 3.5
  - name: Charlie
    age: 20
    major: Physics
    gpa: 3.9
  - name: David
    age: 23
    major: Chemistry
    gpa: 3.2
  - name: Eva
    age: 21
    major: Computer Science
    gpa: 3.7
```

## Python Script (`app.py`)

```python
import yaml

def load_data(file_path):
    """Load data from a YAML file."""
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        data = yaml.safe_load(file)
    return data

def display_students(students):
    """Display information about all students."""
    print("\nAll Students:")
    for student in students:
        print(f"Name: {student['name']}, Age: {student['age']}, Major: {student['major']}, GPA: {student['gpa']}")

def filter_students_by_gpa(students, min_gpa):
    """Filter and display students with a GPA above the specified minimum."""
    filtered_students = [s for s in students if s['gpa'] >= min_gpa]

    print(f"\nStudents with GPA >= {min_gpa}:")
    if filtered_students:
        for student in filtered_students:
            print(f"Name: {student['name']}, Age: {student['age']}, Major: {student['major']}, GPA: {student['gpa']}")
    else:
        print("No students found.")

def main():
    data = load_data('students.yaml')
    students = data['students']

    display_students(students)

    min_gpa = float(input("\nEnter minimum GPA to filter students: "))
    filter_students_by_gpa(students, min_gpa)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Running the Application

Ensure you have the `students.yaml` file in the same directory as `app.py`. Then, run the script:

```sh
python app.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to filter students based on GPA.
